                FULL BIOGRAPHY</h1>
                    <p class="introText">
                      Considers himself a renaissance man, while others think him a git. 
                      <Br></Br>
                      Pete Ireland was born in Westmead, NSW and raised in Penrith, NSW. Heeding his families advise to “get a real job”, he graduated from Sydney University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Economics. While the business world beckoned many of Pete’s fellow graduates, he had always harboured more creative aspirations. After working for a year, Pete relocated to the UK for two years of travel and adventures. While drinking Cerveza in a beautiful traditional Spanish square in Madrid, Pete decided it was time to pursue his dream to work in the film industry. All that he needed was to stop dreaming about it and start working to make it happen. And finish his beer.  
                      <Br></Br>
                      When he returned to Australia from the UK in 2007, Pete paid off his travelling debts and enrolled at the Sydney Film School in 2008. 
                      <Br></Br>
                      Pete produced and directed his first film in 2008, a short documentary called CHASING MEL. The film went on to screen in several film festivals in Australia and overseas, including in the Darling Harbour Australia Day celebrations in 2011. 
                      <Br></Br>
                      After Chasing Mel, Pete became more involved in producing. He was line producer on Cara Lipson Dvorjak’s short film OWNED in 2009, which went onto screen at The St Kilda Film Festival and won Best Film and the Audience Award at the Australia-Japan Forum at the Japanese Film Festival (Sydney, Australia). It also screened on Australian broadcast television (Channel 7). His first film as Producer in 2010, a short comedy TARZAN THE DEAF was selected in the Warrambeen film festival in Victoria in March 2011 and screened alongside an Oscar winning animation in the Mudgee International Film Festival in 2011.
                      <Br></Br>
                      Pete completed his studies at the Sydney Film School (SFS) in 2010, but remained involved in the school as Chairman of their Alumni representative group, The Industry Advisory Board (IAB) from 2009 to 2014. As chair of the IAB, Pete drove many projects such as: a pitch competition and production funding for SFS Alumni; a documentary opportunity for SFS Alumni in India; professional workshops; and information sessions presented by industry guests (e.g. a funding discussion with the commissioning heads from Screen NSW and Screen Australia).  
                      <Br></Br>
                      In order to develop his early career producing skills, Pete accepted a production office role in John Duigan’s feature film CARELESS LOVE in January 2011. The film was released theatrically in 2012. 
                      <Br></Br>
                      Pete's production THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR, a short drama about the subject of child abuse, screened in competition at the FIAPF-accredited Shanghai International Film Festival 2012, won Best Drama at The Blue Mountains Film Festival 2011, screened at the Australian Academy (AACTA) accredited Byron Bay Film Festival 2012, screened in the film market at the Oscar accredited Krakow Film Festival 2012, screened in the United States in the Rochester International Film Festival 2012 and won an audience award in the Sandfly Film Festival (Jervis Bay) in 2011.
                      <Br></Br>
                      In 2012, Pete was accepted as a member of the industry peak body, The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA), in the Producer chapter.
                      <Br></Br>

The film was also nominated for 'Best Documentary' at the Oscar-accredited St Kilda Film Festival and the Blue Mountains Film Festival. 
                      <Br></Br>

In 2017, Pete's latest short independent film 'Pilè' was completed, and went on to screen in the Oldenburg Film Festival and Oscar-accredited festivals St Kilda and Flickerfest.
